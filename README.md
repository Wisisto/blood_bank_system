# blood_bank_system

This is a system which the blood bank organization can deploy and donors who wish to donate blood can register and fill in the necessary details.
A donor have the choice to donate for someone specific or just donate for bank.
Then the blood bank administrators will be able to access the intending donors and make a follow up for them to come and actually donate blood.
They'll then be able to update on the page about some information about the blood, like blood type and some important information, then the donor can just easily see important details and info about their blood.
This system intends to shorten the time one has to spend in the blood bank facility filling the forms and everything, and helping donors get the more important details about their blood.
This will also saves time for blood bank employees spending more time capturing donors data into their systems, which might also be prone to errors.
